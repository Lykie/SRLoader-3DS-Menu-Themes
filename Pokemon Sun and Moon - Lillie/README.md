Theme originally from 3DSThem.es

Notes: Lillie's theme is might be a little weird. (also technically I did this theme myself just using the 3DS theme for reference)
Go to about [line 371](https://github.com/Robz8/SRLoader/blob/master/romsel_dsimenutheme/arm9/source/graphics/graphics.cpp#L371) in "romsel_dsimenutheme/arm9/source/graphics/graphics.cpp" and change 50 to 55 for the music to function properly.
