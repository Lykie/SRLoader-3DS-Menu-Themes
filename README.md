# What is this?
These are just some themes that I cropped and/or scaled to fit onto the 3DS Menu Theme for SRLoader

# "Installation"
Download the source of [SRLoader](https://github.com/Robz8/SRLoader)

Copy the files from the theme of your choosing and paste them into "romsel_dsimenutheme/gfx" and build SRLoader.

# Notes
If you want to "port" your own themes for use, then you'll need to be able to scale/crop them and also limit the image to 16 colors (only required for bottom screen).

I recommend using [XNViewMP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/).

If your image is synced between the top and bottom screens on 3DS, then you should scale the bottom screen image, and crop the top screen canvas while having it align to the bottom.

# How to Limit to 16 Colors
Open the Image in XNViewMP

Click the Image tab

Click "Change Color Depth"

Click the bubble next to the word "Colors"

Click the dropdown menu and click "16"

(Optional) Click "Dithering" and set it to "None"
